# MySmartLock
A small IoT project for a subject at University. 

This project is just a current non-functioning template (due to nonexistent web domain) for a basic web smartlock to be implemented with a Raspberry Pi. The lock itself is simulated via a servo motor.

It is comprised by:
-> A small web platform + database
-> A Python GUI application
-> A basic Android app to play the web application

This project has been presented and defended by Javier Jim√©nez Sicardo (myself) and Eduardo Mayoral Briz during January/February 2019.
